##Issues :
#Enemy Healthbar is always 50% : done
#enemy attacking dodge feature not working : kinda works but still gt issues
    - enemy should not take damage after player dodges enemy's attack.
    - player's health decreases heavily when player fails to dodge enemy attack.( kinda
    ok i guess)

##Enhancements thought of :
#reduce health bar length
#add levels
#Mages have a revive ability that revives the character after death ( one extra life )
#Add a small walkthrough
#add special boosts or moves
#add music and sound effects

##close to impossible Enhancements :
#Add a game ui
